# Cybersecurity Introduction
**Academic Year 2025-2026**  
**Instructor:** Linde Nouwen

## 📋 Course Overview

This course introduces students to the fundamentals of cybersecurity through a practical, hands-on approach. Following the philosophy that "the best defense is a good offense," students will learn to think and act like hackers to better understand and defend against cyber threats.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand the core principles of cybersecurity (CIA triad)
- Apply penetration testing methodologies
- Identify and exploit common vulnerabilities
- Conduct various types of security assessments
- Understand social engineering techniques and defenses
- Write professional penetration testing reports

## 🔐 Core Security Principles

### The CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized individuals
- **Integrity**: Maintaining accuracy and trustworthiness of data and systems
- **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed

## 📚 Course Topics

### 1. Fundamentals
- Security vs. Convenience dilemma
- Ethical hacking principles
- Risk assessment concepts (Assets, Threats, Vulnerabilities, Risks)

### 2. Team Roles & Methodologies
- **Red Team**: Offensive security (attackers perspective)
- **Blue Team**: Defensive security (defenders perspective)
- **Purple Team**: Collaborative red/blue approach
- Penetration testing vs. red teaming

### 3. Penetration Testing Types
- External pentesting
- Internal pentesting  
- Web application pentesting
- Mobile application pentesting
- Infrastructure pentesting
- Network pentesting
- Physical pentesting

### 4. Testing Approaches
- **Black Box**: Minimal information provided
- **White Box**: Full system knowledge provided
- **Grey Box**: Limited information provided

### 5. Social Engineering
Learn about the six principles of human influence:
1. Reciprocity
2. Commitment and Consistency
3. Social Proof
4. Authority
5. Liking
6. Scarcity

Common attack methods covered:
- Phishing & Spear Phishing
- Vishing (Voice phishing)
- Smishing (SMS phishing)
- Impersonation attacks

### 6. Penetration Testing Methodology
1. **Planning**: Define scope and objectives
2. **Footprinting & Scanning**: Information gathering
3. **Enumeration**: Service and vulnerability discovery
4. **Exploitation**: Gaining initial access
5. **Post-exploitation**: Privilege escalation and persistence
6. **Reporting**: Document findings and recommendations
